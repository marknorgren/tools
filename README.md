## Dev Tools


### Ruby

  * Ruby environment mangement [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

### Source Control
I use [git](http://git-scm.com/) for all my version control.

#### Git GUIs

Source tree is my primary Git GUI that I use. It works very well on the Mac, but it does not perform well on Windows. Another option [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) has release version 2. I am keeping on eye on that one, but for now Sourcetree works well for me.
